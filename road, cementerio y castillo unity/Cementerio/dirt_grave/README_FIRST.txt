Dirt Grave***

A perfect prop for Halloween, or any creepy, graveyard or horrific render.

This highly detailed, dirt grave model is available as a native 3dsmax 2012 scene file (.max), and also in several scaled .obj formats, for importing easily into other applications, like Blender, Poser, or Daz|Studio. This object comes complete with very high detail texture maps for every necessary material channel, for the most control over your resulting render.  There is a custom diffuse (color), bump, and specular map for each sub-object in this set, if you wish to use them. Personally, I don't feel there's a need for the specular map, but I have included them anyway.  The model consists of 69,556 polygons and 139,863 verts. Each texture map is provided in maximum quality JPG format, with resolution of 2048x2048 pixels, and is suitable for close-up rendering. You may need to tweak or adjust the power of the bump maps in your software of choice to get the optimum results for rendering.

*All preview renders I have made of this set in the Octane render engine are using the exact maps I've included here.  Please review the special instructions for OBJ import.

You are free to use or modify this model as you see fit for your own projects or scenes; it's great as a decorative outdoor lighting prop, but can also fit into a great many variety of scenes.  The only limit is your imagination.  As with all my freebies, this model can be used for both commercial and non commercial renders. You may not, however, resell these objects, or any derivative of them; individually, or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ users: This model consists of two separate objects: the dirt grave, rocks and cross are all one object; and the shovel model is a separate object.  You can load each object independently.  Each object will have several material zones and polygon groups for easily editing or changing the materials on specific parts.  The POSER-specific OBJ version was exported with a scale conversion that should load with the appropriate scaling into Poser 9 and above. To ensure proper import into Poser, BE SURE to DE-select all check box options boxes in the Import Options dialogue. DESELECT the "Centered", "Place on Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. options in the import dialogue box after you select the poser .obj file, and then the object should load with correct scale into the scene.  In DAZ|STUDIO, simply choose the Poser-scaled .obj version, and import with Poser Preset option from the import dialogue box.  BLENDER users, obviously, choose the Blender scaled .obj.  All other software applications may be best suited to import the standard .obj file.

All textures were created by me, but most of the original reference textures were from CGTextures.com texture resource website, as well as other free texture repositories in some cases.

Have fun, and let me know if there are any issues, or if you have any questions on how to properly use this model:  luxxeon@zoho.com
